<h1 align="center">Twikey API client for Ruby</h1>

Want to allow your customers to pay in the most convenient way, then Twikey is right what you need.

Recurring or occasional payments via (Recurring) Credit Card, SEPA Direct Debit or any other payment method by bringing
your own payment service provider or by leveraging your bank contract.

Twikey offers a simple and safe multichannel solution to negotiate and collect recurring (or even occasional) payments.
Twikey has integrations with a lot of accounting and CRM packages. It is the first and only provider to operate on a
European level for Direct Debit and can work directly with all major Belgian and Dutch Banks. However you can use the
payment options of your favorite PSP to allow other customers to pay as well.

## Requirements ##

To use the Twikey API client, the following things are required:

+ Get yourself a [Twikey account](https://www.twikey.com).
+ Ruby >= 3.2
+ Up-to-date OpenSSL (or other SSL/TLS toolkit)

## Gem Installation ##

By far the easiest way to install the Twikey API client is to gem install it

    $ gem install twikey-api-ruby 

## How to create anything ##

The api works the same way regardless if you want to create a mandate, a transaction, an invoice or even a paylink.
the following steps should be implemented:

1. Use the Twikey API client to create or import your item.

2. Once available, our platform will send an asynchronous request to the configured webhook
   to allow the details to be retrieved. As there may be multiple items ready for you a "feed" endpoint is provided
   which acts like a queue that can be read until empty till the next time.

3. The customer returns, and should be satisfied to see that the action he took is completed.
